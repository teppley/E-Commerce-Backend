## Installation

To install this application, the code can be copied and installed using (npm install) from the terminal. The .env file would need to be updated to your personal username and password. The files would then need to be seeded to the database using (npm run seed) from the terminal. Then the port needs to be started using (node server.js) from the terminal.


## Usage

This application can be utilized by using a program that interacts with the API, example (Postman or Insomnia). The user can make different 'get' requests to the database to return data for products, product categories, and product tags. The user can also use 'post' requests to create new products, categories, and tags. Lastly users can update products using a 'put' request, and delete data using a 'del' request.
